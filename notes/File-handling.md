# C++ File Handling

File handling in C++ is a mechanism to create and perform read/write operations on a file.

We can access various file handling methods in C++ by importing the `<fstream>` class.

```cpp
#include <fstream>
```

`<fstream>` includes two classes for file handling:

- `ifstream` - to read from a file.
- `ofstream` - to create/open and write to a file.

## Opening and Closing a File

In order to work with files, we first need to open them. In C++, we can open a file using the `ofstream` and `ifstream` classes.

For example, here's how we can open a file using `ofstream`:

```cpp
std::ofstream my_file("example.txt");
```

Here,
- `my_file` - the name of the object of the `ofstream` class.
- `example.txt` - the name and extension of the file we want to open.

Note: We can also use the `open()` function to open a file. For example,

```cpp
std::ofstream my_file.open("example.txt");
```

### Closing a File

Once we're done working with a file, we need to close it using the `close()` function.

```cpp
my_file.close();
```
## Example : 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std; 

int main() {

    // opening a text file for writing
    ofstream my_file("example.txt");

    // close the file
    my_file.close();

    return 0;
}
```
## Checking the File for Errors

In file handling, it's important to ensure the file was opened without any error before we can perform any further operations on it. There are three common ways to check files for errors:

## 1. By Checking the File Object

```cpp
ofstream my_file("example.txt");

// check if the file has been opened properly
if (!my_file) {
    // print error message
    cout << "Error opening the file." << endl;

    // terminate the main() function
    return 1;
}
```

Notice the condition in the `if` statement:

```cpp
if (!my_file) {...}
```

This method checks if the file is in an error state by evaluating the file object itself.

- If the file has been opened successfully, the condition evaluates to true.
- If there's an error, it evaluates to false, and you can handle the error accordingly.

## 2. Using the `is_open()` Function

The `is_open()` function returns:

- `true` - if the file was opened successfully.
- `false` - if the file failed to open or if it is in a state of error.

For example,

```cpp
ofstream my_file("example.txt");

if (!my_file.is_open()) {
    cout << "Error opening the file." << endl;
    return 1;
}
```

## 3. Using the `fail()` Function

The `fail()` function returns:

- `true` - if the file failed to open or if it is in a state of error.
- `false` - if the file was opened successfully.

```cpp
ofstream my_file("example.txt");

if (my_file.fail()) {
    cout << "Error opening the file." << endl;
    return 1;
}
```
# Reading From a File

Reading from text files is done by opening the file using the `ifstream` class. For example,

```cpp
ifstream my_file("example.txt");
```

Then, we need to read the file line-by-line. To do this, we need to loop through each line of the file until all the lines are read, i.e., until we reach the end of the file.

We use the `eof()` function for this purpose, which returns

- `true` - if the file pointer points to the end of the file
- `false` - if the file pointer doesn't point to the end of the file

For example,

```cpp
// variable to store file content
string line;

// loop until the end of the file
while (!my_file.eof()) {

    // store the current line of the file
    // in the "line" variable
    getline(my_file, line);

    // print the line variable
    cout << line << endl;
}
```

Here, the `while` loop will run until the end of the file. In each iteration of the loop,

- `getline(my_file, line);` reads the current line of the file and stores it in the `line` variable.
- Then, it prints the `line` variable.

### Program Read From a File:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std; 

int main() {

    // open a text file for reading
    ifstream my_file("example.txt");

    // check the file for errors
    if(!my_file) {
        cout << "Error: Unable to open the file." << endl;
        return 1; 
    }

    // store the contents of the file in "line" string
    string line;

    // loop until the end of the text file
    while (!my_file.eof()) {

        // store the current line of the file
        // in the "line" variable
        getline(my_file, line);

        // print the line variable
        cout << line << endl;
    }

    // close the file
    my_file.close();

    return 0;
}
```
# Writing to a File

We use the `ofstream` class to write to a file. For example,

```cpp
ofstream my_file("example.txt");
```

We can then write to the file by using the insertion operator `<<` with the `ofstream` object `my_file`. For example,

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // open a text file for writing
    ofstream my_file("example.txt");

    // check the file for errors
    if(!my_file) {
        cout << "Error: Unable to open the file." << endl;
        return 1; 
    }

    // write multiple lines to the file
    my_file << "Line 1" << endl;
    my_file << "Line 2" << endl;
    my_file << "Line 3" << endl;

    // close the file
    my_file.close();

    return 0;
}
```

Notice the following code for writing to the file:

```cpp
my_file << "Line 1" << endl;
my_file << "Line 2" << endl;
my_file << "Line 3" << endl;
```

This is similar to printing output to a screen:

```cpp
cout << "Line 1" << endl;
```

In file handling, we just replace `cout` with the file object to write to the file instead of the console.

Our particular code will write the following text to `example.txt`:

```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
```

Note: Writing to an existing file will overwrite the existing contents of the file.

## Append to a Text File

To add/append to the existing content of a file, you need to open the file in append mode.

In C++, you can achieve this by using the `ios::app` flag when opening the file:

```cpp
ofstream my_file("example.txt", ios::app);
```

Now, let's add some more text to the existing content of `example.txt`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // open a text file for appending
    ofstream my_file("example.txt", ios::app);

    // if the file doesn't open successfully, print an error message
    if(!my_file) {
        cout << "Failed to open the file for appending." << endl;
        return 1;  
    }

    // append multiple lines to the file
    my_file << "Line 4" << endl;
    my_file << "Line 5" << endl;
    my_file << "Line 6" << endl;

    // close the file
    my_file.close();

    return 0;
}
```

This will add the following lines to `example.txt`:

```
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
```
## File Handling With `fstream`

Instead of using `ifstream` to read from a file and `ofstream` to write to the file, we can simply use the `fstream` class for all file operations.

The constructor for `fstream` allows you to specify the file name and the mode for file operations.

| Mode             | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ios::in`        | Opens the file to read (default for `ifstream`).         |
| `ios::out`       | Opens the file to write (default for `ofstream`).        |
| `ios::app`       | Opens the file and appends new content to it at the end. |
| `ios::ate`       | Data can be written anywhere in the file.                |
| `ios::binary`    | Read/write data in binary format.                        |
| `ios::trunc`     | Discard the filesâ€™ contents if it exists.                |
| `ios::nocreate`  | If the file does NOT exist, the open operation fails.    |
| `ios::noreplace` | If the file exists, the open operation fails.            |

Let's look at an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    // 1. write to a text file
    fstream my_file("example.txt", ios::out);

    if (my_file) {
        my_file << "This is a test line." << endl;
        my_file.close();
    }
    else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for writing." << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // 2. read from the same file
    string line;
    my_file.open("example.txt", ios::in);
    
    if (my_file) {
        while (!my_file.eof()) {
            getline(my_file, line);
            cout << "Read from file: " << line << endl;
        }
        my_file.close();
    }
    else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for reading." << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // 3. append data to the end of the file
    my_file.open("example.txt", ios::app);

    if (my_file) {
        my_file << "This is another test line, appended to the file." << endl;
        my_file.close();
    }
    else {
        cout << "Unable to open file for appending." << endl;
        return 1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Output**

```
Read from file: This is a test line.
```
## File Position Pointer in C++

The `<istream>` and `<ostream>` classes provide member functions for repositioning the file pointer (the byte number of the next byte in the file to be read or to be written.)

These member functions are:
- `seekg` (seek get) for `istream` class
- `seekp` (seek put) for `ostream` class

## Examples of Moving a File Pointer

```cpp
// Repositions the file get pointer to the beginning of the file
inClientFile.seekg(0);

// Repositions the file get pointer to the n-th byte of the file
inClientFile.seekg(n, ios::beg);

// Repositions the file get pointer to the m-th byte from the end of file
inClientFile.seekg(m, ios::end);

// Repositions the file get pointer to the end of the file
inClientFile.seekg(0, ios::end);
```

The same operations can be performed with `<ostream>` function member `seekp`.

## Member Functions `tellg()` and `tellp()`

Member functions `tellg` and `tellp` are provided to return the current locations of the get and put pointers, respectively.

```cpp
long location = inClientFile.tellg();
```

To move the pointer relative to the current location, use `ios::cur`.

```cpp
// Moves the file get pointer n bytes forward
inClientFile.seekg(n, ios::cur);
```
### close a file:
It is done by FilePointer.close().

## Special operations in a File
- There are few important functions to be used with file streams like:
- `tellp()` - It tells the current position of the put pointer. Syntax: `filepointer.tellp()`
- `tellg()` - It tells the current position of the get pointer.Syntax: `filepointer.tellg()`
- `seekp()` - It moves the put pointer to mentioned location.Syntax: `filepointer.seekp(no of bytes,reference mode)`
- `seekg()` - It moves get pointer(input) to a specified location.Syntax: `filepointer.seekg((no of bytes,reference point)`
- `put()` - It writes a single character to file.
- `get()` - It reads a single character from file.
- Note: For seekp and seekg three reference points are passed:
`ios::beg` - beginning of the file
`ios::cur` - current position in the file
`ios::end` - end of the file

## Output:
```
New file created File Pointer Position is 13
 As per tellp File Pointer Position is 12
As per tellg File Pointer Position is 5
As per tellg File Pointer Position is 6
```
